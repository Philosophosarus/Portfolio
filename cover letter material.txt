To whom it may concern,
I am writing to you with full transparency.
My applied with Resume is not up to date, and does not reflect the whole of my work experience. This is intentional. I find it better to communicate who I am in person. And express why I'm a great hire and a highly valuable addition to any team. 

I hope you are open to taking a chance on meeting someone less polished on paper.
As they say. Fortune favors the bold. 
Good day, and thank you.
